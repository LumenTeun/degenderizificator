#The amazing degenderizificator


####Description
The degenderizificator is, first and foremost, a moderately hard name to spell correctly, so forgive me for any slight variations (and I'm mostly speaking to my future self who will spend hours not finding retched bugs, just to realize that they wrote 'denerizificicator' somewhere).
Second and secondmost, it is a browser addons (this version for Firefox) which aims to degenderize your browsing experience. "What does that even mean?!" you might be asking yourself. Well, I'll tell you what it means. It means that this addon will (sometimes not so) effectively replace gendered language with gender neutral language, or in other words: RABBLE RABBLE DIE CIS-SCUM FUCK THE PATRIARCHY!!!11
No, but seriously though. Gendered language is mainly gender specific pronouns - she, he - and regular nouns - man, woman. (I'm sorry if I'm getting something wrong, I'm not too grammarily inclined.)
As of now, this addon is *very* limited, and only supports some Swedish pronouns, mainly because I'm Swedish, but also because it's 3:30AM. In the future, I hope to add more Swedish words as well as English ones, complete with preferences to allow the user to set language(s) and level of aggressivness. If you are a timetraveler or is somehow reading this from the future and the previous is not yet true, I have probably reverted back into a cocoon made from bed sheets and cookie crumbs, and you may either wait patiently or fork the project till your heart's content.

####Acknowledgements
So, this addon is made possible largely because of [danodemano's fork](https://github.com/danodemano/cloud-to-butt-mozilla) of [DaveRandom's fork](https://github.com/DaveRandom/cloud-to-butt-mozilla) of [Steven Frank's cloud-to-butt Chrome extension](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt). Fork central, am I right? Thanks!

####Installation
This addon is built using [Mozilla's Add-on SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK). Super easy if you know how to read and follow instructions.
I'll try to figure out how GitHub does releases and make the XPI file available here, and if I go totally wild and crazy I might even try my luck at Mozilla's Add-on library thing, who knows?
